# greenbox-shop-rest
This is my first RESTful project that is using Spring and JPA. 
It's an online grocery store where the customers can place orders containing items. Some items (vegetables or fruits) are measured in weight, while other are counted. A shop employee can get a summary for all the items they have to acquire.
It is going to be linked with a frontend application further on.
